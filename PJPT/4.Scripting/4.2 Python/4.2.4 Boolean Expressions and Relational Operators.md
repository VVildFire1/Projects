# 4.2.4 Boolean Expressions and Relational Operators

In Python, boolean expressions are expressions that evaluate to either `True` or `False`. They are used in conditional statements and logical operations to make decisions based on conditions. Relational operators compare values to create boolean expressions.

## Relational Operators

Python provides several relational operators for value comparison:

- Equality (`==`): Checks if two values are equal.
- Inequality (`!=`): Checks if two values are not equal.
- Greater than (`>`): Checks if the left value is greater than the right.
- Less than (`<`): Checks if the left value is less than the right.
- Greater than or equal to (`>=`): Checks if the left value is greater or equal to the right.
- Less than or equal to (`<=`): Checks if the left value is less or equal to the right.

## Boolean Expressions

Boolean expressions use logical operators to combine relational expressions:

- Logical AND (`and`): True if both operands are True.
- Logical OR (`or`): True if at least one operand is True.
- Logical NOT (`not`): Negates the operand's value.

## Examples

```python
x = 5
y = 10

# Relational operators
print(x == y)   # Output: False
print(x < y)    # Output: True

# Boolean expressions
print(x < y and y > 0)    # Output: True
print(x < y or y < 0)     # Output: True
print(not (x == y))       # Output: True
```

The example above demonstrates using relational operators (`==` and `<`) to compare values of `x` and `y` and create boolean expressions. Logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) combine the relational expressions to evaluate their overall truth value.

Boolean expressions and relational operators are crucial for controlling program flow by making decisions based on conditions. They are used in `if` statements, `while` loops, and other control structures to determine your code's execution path.
