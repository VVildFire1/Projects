# Strings in Python

In Python, the `str` (string) data type represents a sequence of characters. Strings are immutable, which means they cannot be changed after they are created.

## Creation
Strings can be enclosed in single quotes or double quotes.
```python
my_string = 'Hello, World!'  # Using single quotes
my_string = "Hello, World!"  # Using double quotes
```

## Accessing Characters
You can access individual characters in a string using indexing.
```python
print(my_string[0])  # Outputs 'H'
```

## String Concatenation
Join two or more strings using the `+` operator.
```python
greeting = 'Hello' + ' ' + 'World!'
print(greeting)  # Outputs 'Hello World!'
```

## String Length
Determine the length of a string with the `len()` function.
```python
print(len(my_string))  # Outputs the length of my_string
```

## String Slicing
Extract a substring using slicing with start and end indices.
```python
substring = my_string[7:12]
print(substring)  # Outputs 'World'
```

## String Methods
Python has various built-in methods for string manipulation.
```python
print(my_string.upper())  # Outputs 'HELLO, WORLD!'
```

## String Formatting
Embed values into a string using the `%` operator or the `format()` method.
```python
name = 'Alice'
age = 30
print("My name is %s and I'm %d years old." % (name, age))
# Outputs: My name is Alice and I'm 30 years old.
```

Strings are versatile in Python, supporting a wide range of operations and manipulations for various applications.
