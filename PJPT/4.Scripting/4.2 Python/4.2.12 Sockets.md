# Sockets in Python

Sockets are a fundamental networking concept in Python used for communication between computers over a network. They enable programs to establish connections, send data, and receive data over protocols like TCP and UDP.

## Socket Creation

To create sockets in Python, import the socket module and use the `socket.socket()` function with the address family and socket type parameters.

```python
import socket

# Create a TCP socket
tcp_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

# Create a UDP socket
udp_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
```

## Socket Communication

With a socket object, you can use methods to connect, send, and receive data.

- `socket.connect(address)`: Establish a connection.
- `socket.bind(address)`: Bind the socket to an address and port.
- `socket.listen(backlog)`: Listen for incoming connections on TCP.
- `socket.accept()`: Accept a connection, returning a new socket.
- `socket.send(data)`: Send data.
- `socket.recv(buffer_size)`: Receive data.

Here's an example of a basic TCP server:

```python
import socket

# Create a TCP socket
server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

# Bind the socket to an address and port
server_address = ('localhost', 1234)
server_socket.bind(server_address)

# Listen for incoming connections
server_socket.listen(5)

while True:
    # Accept a client connection
    client_socket, client_address = server_socket.accept()

    # Receive and send data
    data = client_socket.recv(1024)
    client_socket.sendall(b"Received: " + data)

    # Close the client socket
    client_socket.close()
```

Socket programming allows the creation of client-server and networked applications, providing a way to communicate over networks using different protocols. The socket module offers various functions and methods for efficient network communication.
