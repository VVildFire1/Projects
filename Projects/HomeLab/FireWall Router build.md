Ok so my Hard ware has arrived


MOGINSOK 4x 2.5GbE Mini PC [[Amazon Link](https://amzn.to/4aKXqXf)] - Features a 12th Gen Intel Core i3 N305 processor (up to 3.4GHz and 8 Cores) I got the barebones

Timetec 32GB DDR5 4800MHz [[Amazon Link](https://amzn.to/48tV9y7)] 

PNY CS1030 1TB M.2 NVMe PCIe Gen3 x4 Internal Solid State Drive (SSD) [[Amazon Link](https://amzn.to/3HeBu9C)]

First thing I need to do is install the Ram and the SSD. This item is a lot smaller then I thought but that's a good thing. Ram fits no problem and there is 2 M.2 ports. Might upgrade and add a 2nd SSD later not sure right now. 

Downloading ProxMox Virtual Environment this is going to be my main boot OS

After Downloading this i will need to write the iso to a Flashdrive the image is under 2 GB so thats not to hard.

To do this i will be using Rufus https://rufus.ie/en/ I have been useing this program for awhile for my Pi and other things and it is easy


# Making the Boot loader

Step 1. Make sure the USB I am going to flash in Blank or i dont need the data on it.

Step 2. click select on Rufus and find your ISO. 

Step 3. Make sure the Device is set to your Flash drive and click start.

wow that was so hard. any way now we just wait for the drive to be completed
