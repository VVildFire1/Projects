# Ethical Hacking

Ethical hacking, also known as penetration testing or white-hat hacking, involves a structured approach to identifying and remedying vulnerabilities in computer systems and networks. The process includes the following stages:

## Reconnaissance

The first stage involves passive information gathering about the target system or network, such as searching publicly available databases, examining DNS records, and browsing websites to collect information and identify potential entry points.

## Scanning

The ethical hacker actively probes the target system or network during this stage to discover open ports, services, and vulnerabilities using tools for port scanning, network mapping, and vulnerability scanning to identify weaknesses.

## Gaining Access

This critical stage involves attempting to gain unauthorized access to the target using techniques like password cracking, social engineering, and exploiting software vulnerabilities based on information from the scanning stage.

## Maintaining Access

After gaining access, the ethical hacker works to maintain control over the system by bypassing security, setting up backdoors, and ensuring persistent access to assess the potential impact of a breach.

## Covering Tracks

The final stage requires the ethical hacker to erase any signs of the penetration testing from the target system, including deleting logs, removing files, and restoring systems to their pre-testing state to remain undetected.

Ethical hacking must always be conducted with proper authorization, adhering to legal and ethical standards, maintaining confidentiality, and with express permission from the owners of the systems and networks involved.
