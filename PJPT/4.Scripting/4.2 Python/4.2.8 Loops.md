# Python Loops

Loops in Python are used to execute a block of code repeatedly. Python provides two primary types of loops: `for` and `while`.

## For Loop
The `for` loop is used for iterating over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string).

```python
# Iterating over a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
# Output: apple
# Output: banana
# Output: cherry
```

With the `range()` function, you can execute a set number of iterations:
```python
# Using range() function
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
# Output: 0
# Output: 1
# Output: 2
# Output: 3
# Output: 4
```

## While Loop
The `while` loop enables code to execute as long as a certain condition is true.

```python
# Using the while loop
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
# Output: 0
# Output: 1
# Output: 2
# Output: 3
# Output: 4
```

## Loop Control Statements
Control statements can change the execution from its normal sequence:

- `break`: Terminates the loop and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop.
- `continue`: Skips the current iteration and continues with the next iteration.
- `pass`: Does nothing; acts as a placeholder.

```python
# Using break
for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        break
    print(i)
# Output: 0
# Output: 1
# Output: 2
# Output: 3
# Output: 4

# Using continue
for i in range(10):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        continue
    print(i)
# Output: 1
# Output: 3
# Output: 5
# Output: 7
# Output: 9

# Using pass
for i in range(10):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        pass  # This will do nothing
    else:
        print(i)
# Output: 1
# Output: 3
# Output: 5
# Output: 7
# Output: 9
```

Loops are a fundamental part of Python programming for executing repetitive tasks, allowing for the automation and efficiency of code.
