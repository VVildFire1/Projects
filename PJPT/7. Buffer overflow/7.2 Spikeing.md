```shell
generic_send_tcp
```



making a file called stats.spk

```shell
s_readline();
s_string("STATS ");
s_string_variable("0");

```

```shell
generic_send_tcp {ipaddress port} stats.spk 0 0 
```

this would spike the command for stats
now we make one for a new command this time TRUN

making a file called trun.spk

```shell
s_readline();
s_string("TRUN ");
s_string_variable("0");

```

```shell
generic_send_tcp {ipaddress port} trun.spk 0 0 
```
