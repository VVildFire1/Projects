# Dictionaries in Python

In Python, a dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. It is a versatile and powerful data structure for storing, retrieving, and manipulating data based on unique keys.

## Dictionary Creation
To create a dictionary, enclose key-value pairs within curly braces `{}`, with each pair separated by a colon `:`.
```python
student = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 20,
    "major": "Computer Science"
}
```

## Dictionary Access
Access values in a dictionary by referring to their keys.
```python
print(student["name"])   # Output: "Alice"
print(student["age"])    # Output: 20
```

## Dictionary Modification
Dictionaries are mutable, allowing modification of values by assigning new values to keys.
```python
student["age"] = 21          # Modifying a value
student["city"] = "London"   # Adding a new key-value pair
```

## Dictionary Operations
Various operations can be performed on dictionaries, like getting their length, iterating over them, and deleting key-value pairs.
```python
# Length
print(len(student))          # Output: 3

# Iteration
for key in student:
    print(key, student[key])  # Outputs: "name Alice", "age 20", "major Computer Science"

# Deletion
del student["age"]           # Deleting a key-value pair
```

Dictionaries are powerful data structures used for organizing and manipulating data, providing quick and efficient access based on keys.
