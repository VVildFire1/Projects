# Sublist3r Guide


Prerequisites
- Python: Sublist3r is written in Python. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
- pip: This is Python's package installer. You'll need it to install Sublist3r and its dependencies.

Installation
1. Clone the Repository:
   - Use Git to clone the Sublist3r repository: git clone https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r.git

2. Install Dependencies:
   - Navigate to the Sublist3r directory: cd Sublist3r
   - Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
- Basic Usage:
  - Run Sublist3r by executing: python sublist3r.py -d [domain]
  - Replace [domain] with the domain name you want to enumerate. For example, python sublist3r.py -d example.com.

- Options:
  - -b: Enable Bing search engine. By default, Bing is disabled.
  - -p [ports]: Scan the found subdomains against specific ports. Example: python sublist3r.py -d example.com -p 80,443.
  - -v: Enable verbose mode. This will display detailed information about the search.
  - -t [num_threads]: Set the number of threads. More threads can speed up the search.
  - -e [engines]: Specify specific engines. Example: python sublist3r.py -d example.com -e google,yahoo,bing.
  - -o [output]: Save found subdomains to a file.

Example Command
python sublist3r.py -d example.com -p 80,443 -v -t 10 -o example.txt
This command will enumerate subdomains for example.com, scan them against ports 80 and 443, use verbose mode, set 10 threads, and save the output to example.txt.

Post-Usage
- After the enumeration is complete, you'll see a list of discovered subdomains.
- If you chose to save the output, check the specified file for the list.

Notes
- Sublist3r's effectiveness depends on the sources it queries. Some domains may have security measures that limit the visibility of their subdomains.
- Always use tools like Sublist3r ethically and with permission when necessary, especially in a professional or testing environment.
