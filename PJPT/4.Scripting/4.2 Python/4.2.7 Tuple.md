# Tuples in Python

In Python, a tuple is an ordered collection of elements, similar to a list. However, unlike lists, tuples are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be modified once they are created.

## Tuple Creation
To create a tuple, you enclose comma-separated values within parentheses ( ).
```python
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "orange")
```

## Tuple Access
You can access individual elements in a tuple using indexing, similar to lists. Indexing starts from 0 for the first element.
```python
print(fruits[0])    # Output: "apple"
print(fruits[2])    # Output: "orange"
```

## Tuple Immutability
Tuples are immutable, meaning you cannot modify their elements. Once a tuple is created, its values cannot be changed.
```python
# fruits[1] = "grape"    # This will raise an error because tuples are immutable
```

## Tuple Operations
Although tuples are immutable, you can perform certain operations on them like concatenation, length, and slicing.
```python
# Concatenation
fruits2 = ("grape", "kiwi")
combined = fruits + fruits2
print(combined)         # Output: ("apple", "banana", "orange", "grape", "kiwi")

# Length
print(len(fruits))      # Output: 3

# Slicing
subtuple = fruits[1:3]
print(subtuple)         # Output: ("banana", "orange")
```

Tuples are useful in situations where you want to store a collection of values that should not be changed. They can be used to group related data elements and can also be used as keys in dictionaries. While tuples are immutable, they offer advantages such as faster performance and protection against unintentional modification.
