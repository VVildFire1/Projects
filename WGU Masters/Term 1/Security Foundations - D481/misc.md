Cut-through is a [packet-switching](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/packet-switching-and-delays-in-computer-network/) method, where the switch forwards a packet as soon as the destination address is processed without waiting for the entire packet to be received. The next packet is sent as soon as the previous one has been verified as reaching the recipient without waiting for the complete transmission of the previous packet.
