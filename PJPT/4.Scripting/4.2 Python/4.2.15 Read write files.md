# File Operations in Python

In Python, the `open()` function is used to read from and write to files. Here is how it works:

## Reading Files

To read from a file, open it in read mode with 'r'.

```python
# Reading an entire file
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)

# Reading a single line
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    line = file.readline()
    print(line)

# Reading all lines into a list
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    lines = file.readlines()
    print(lines)
```

## Writing Files

To write to a file, open it in write mode with 'w'. This will overwrite any existing file with the same name.

```python
# Writing to a file
with open("example.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, World!\n")
    file.write("This is a new line.")
```

## Appending to Files

To append to an existing file, open it in append mode with 'a'.

```python
# Appending to a file
with open("example.txt", "a") as file:
    file.write("\nThis is appended content.")
```

Using the `with` statement ensures that the file is properly closed after its suite finishes, even if an exception is raised.

Reading and writing to files is essential for handling external data, processing information, and storing outputs. Always manage file resources carefully to prevent memory leaks and ensure data integrity.
