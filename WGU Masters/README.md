# WGU Masters Notes

## Overview

Welcome to my personal repository of notes for the Masters program at Western Governors University (WGU). This folder is intended to serve as a digital notebook, containing a wide array of information and resources I encounter and compile throughout my studies.

## Purpose

The purpose of this collection is to have a centralized place to store notes, thoughts, snippets, and any other relevant information I find valuable during my master's journey. The content here will likely be diverse and somewhat unstructured, mirroring the exploratory and often spontaneous nature of learning.

## Contents

The notes in this repository will cover a variety of topics, potentially including but not limited to:
- Course-specific notes
- Research articles and summaries
- Code snippets and programming concepts
- Study guides and strategies
- Important links and resources

## Organization

As a living document, the organization of this folder might start as unstructured but will evolve over time. Initially, it will include a mix of text files, PDFs, and other formats as I capture information. I encourage revisiting and reorganizing the contents periodically to maintain relevance and usability.

## Disclaimer

Please note:
- **Raw and Unorganized**: Most of the content will be raw and unorganized, reflecting real-time learning and note-taking.
- **Personal Use**: These notes are primarily for my personal use and may not always follow a structured or standardized format Chat GPT is used to help me keep things cleaner.
- **Discoveries**: Amidst the chaos, there might be insightful discoveries and useful nuggets of informationâ€”keep an eye out for these!

## Contribution

While this is a personal note collection, I welcome insights, corrections, or contributions from fellow students or interested parties. If you see an error or have something to add, please feel free to reach out or suggest edits.
