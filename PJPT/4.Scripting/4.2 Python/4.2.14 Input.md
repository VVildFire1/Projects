# User Input in Python

In Python, the `input()` function is used to take user input. The function pauses program execution to allow the user to type in a response, which is then returned as a string.

```python
# Prompting for input and printing a greeting
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello, " + name + "!")
```

In the example above, `input()` prompts the user to enter their name, which is then used in a greeting.

The `input()` function always returns input as a string. To convert this input into a different data type, such as an integer, you can use functions like `int()`.

```python
# Converting string input to an integer
age = input("Enter your age: ")
age = int(age)  # Conversion to integer
print("You will be " + str(age + 1) + " next year.")
```

Here, the user's age is input as a string, converted to an integer, and then used in a message about the user's age next year.

To create interactive programs, you can combine `input()` with conditionals to respond to user input.

```python
# A simple interactive calculator
x = float(input("Give me a number: "))
o = input("Give me an operator: ")
y = float(input("Give me yet another number: "))

if o == "+":
    print(x + y)
elif o == "-":
    print(x - y)
elif o == "/":
    print(x / y)
elif o == "*":
    print(x * y)
elif o == "**":
    print(x ** y)
else:
    print("Unknown operator.")
```

The above code snippet is a simple calculator that takes numerical input and an operator from the user, performs the specified operation, and prints the result. Note that the numerical inputs are converted to `float` to accommodate decimal numbers.
