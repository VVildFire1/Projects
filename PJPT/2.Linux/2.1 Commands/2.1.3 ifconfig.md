`ifconfig` (interface configuration) is a command-line utility used to configure and display network interface parameters on Unix and Unix-like systems.

## Usage
- To view all interfaces and their settings: `ifconfig -a`
- To configure an IP address: `ifconfig [interface] [ip_address]`

## Options
- `[interface]`: Specifies the interface, e.g., `eth0`, `wlan0`.
- `[ip_address]`: Sets the IP address for the interface.
- `netmask [mask]`: Sets the subnet mask.
- `up`: Activates an interface.
- `down`: Deactivates an interface.

## Examples
- View all active interfaces: `ifconfig`
- Set IP address: `ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.10 netmask 255.255.255.0`
- Enable or disable an interface: `ifconfig eth0 up` or `ifconfig eth0 down`

## Common Uses
- Checking the network configuration.
- Assigning IP addresses and netmasks to interfaces.
- Enabling or disabling network interfaces.
- Troubleshooting network issues.

## Note
`ifconfig` is deprecated in favor of the `ip` command suite, and it may not be present in newer Linux distributions by default. However, it's still widely used and known for its simplicity.
